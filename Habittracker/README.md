# Habit Tracker

## Project Description

The Habit Tracker is a command-line application designed to help users create, manage, and analyze their habits. The tracker allows users to set daily or weekly habits, check habits, and view streaks and breaks. The app also provides analytical features such as identifying the longest habit streak, current streaks, and habits with the longest breaks. Data is stored locally using SQLite.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed Python 3.8 or higher.
- You have access to a terminal or command-line interface to run Python scripts.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone <repository-url>


3. **Install the required dependencies**  
Manually install the required Python modules using `pip`:
pip install click pip install sqlite3 pip install random
These modules are used in the project:
- **Click**: Used for creating the command-line interface (CLI).
- **SQLite3**: Used for managing the habit data storage in a local database.
- **Pytest**
- **random**
- **datetime**
- **enum**

4. **Run the application**  
After installing the dependencies, run the following command to get a list of available commands:
python cli.py or in some cases python3 cli.py

Now the project is set up and ready to use. Follow the [Usage Instructions](#usage-instructions) for more details on how to interact with the CLI.

## Usage Instructions

### General CLI Information
- Every command should be run as: `python cli.py <command>`.
- The **database is handled automatically**, so no setup is needed.
- You can see a list of all available commands by simply running:
python cli.py
- Each command includes options that you can choose from, and the system will guide you through input prompts after running the command.
- Generally speaking you can analyse, create and check habits in any way defined by the command tool
- The following will show you list of possible functionalities
* you can use the whole commmands directly, instead going through them step by step for some

### 3. Longest Habit Streak of All Habits and specific

To find the habit with the longest streak, use the `max_value` command with `longest_streak`.
